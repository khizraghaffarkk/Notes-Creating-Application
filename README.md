I have developed a small notes application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this app, user can create important notes and also delete them. Besides, I have used the local storage which will help the user to see the notes everytime when he open the browser. These notes will be those which he has created before and closed the broswer. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
