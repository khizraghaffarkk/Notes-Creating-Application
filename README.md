I have developed a small note application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this app, users can create important notes and also delete them. Besides, I have used the local storage which will help the user to see the notes whenever he opens the browser. These notes will be those that he has created before and closed the browser. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
